Usage:
    qbatch [options] [-q queue] -- command

    qbatch is designed to be inserted before any command that you would
    usually run from the command line. In case of argument collision where
    both your command and qbatch share an option such as --verbose be sure
    to use the '--' syntax to split qbatch options from the commands options

       $ qbatch --verbose -- mincmath --verbose ...

Options:
    -v, --verbose
        Be noisy when doing things (most importantly this will echo the
        resulting script to the terminal)

    --version
        Print version number and exit

    -h, --help
        Dump some quick help output

    --man
        Dump a man page

    -f, --fake
        Don't run anything, This is useful when combined with --verbose or
        --script

    -s, --script
        Output the batch script to the specified filename

    -q, --queue
        Specify a queue to run a job in. Use something like all.q@hostname

        Specify a job name to run the job as. By default this will be

        Specify a list of job dependencies by job name or number which have
        to run before this job will

    -o, --logfile
        Logfile for output of the command. By Default this will make a file

        Process ID of the instance of qbatch

    -l, --resource_list
        Resource List parameters. By Default this will be h_vmem=16GB -
